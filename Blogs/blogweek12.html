      <h2>Blog Post 9: Week 12</h2>
      <article class="blog-content">
        <h3>
          How our code matters as developers in the context of decolonialism,
          and identifying things in our own coding practice that we must be
          aware of.
        </h3>

        <p>
          When looking at how code intersects with decolonialism it means
          recognising technology as not being neutral as it reflects the values,
          assumptions and power structures of its creators. Things to be aware
          of in my own coding practice or any developers coding practice are to
          start with, the default cultural assumptions as many codebases and
          software systems are built around assumptions rooted in Western norms.
          These norms include default languages, calendar systems or UI/UX
          expectations. Machine learning models and datasets can also reinforce
          colonial patterns when they disproportionately represent certain
          groups and in order to combat this in a decolonial practice it means
          questioning where data comes from, who is represented and who is
          erased. We also have to be aware of our tool choice and
          infrastructure. The platforms and tools chosen often depend on Western
          corporate ecosystems. A decolonial approach might involve supporting
          community built or locally governed technologies instead. Lastly a
          major thing that we should be aware of is ensuring that code should
          support and not extract from peoples autonomy over their digital
          lives.

        <h3>Development Process</h3>

        <p>
          There is still a lot of CSS that I would like to refine in my website.
          This week I will be looking more into JavaScript, I have implemented
          some JS into my website, but I will look into it more in detail this
          week upon refining CSS as well for the next assignment. JavaScript
          plays a crucial role in streamlining interaction design by making the
          website dynamic, responsive and user-friendly. It will allow users of
          my site to interact with the dropdown menus for different sections of
          the portfolio page for example. It will be used to implement smooth
          animations and transitions that guide the users attention and make
          actions feel natural this also includes button hover effects, smooth
          scrolling or loading indicators.
