      <h2>Week 4 – Blog Post</h2>

      <article class="blog-content">
        <section>
          <h3>
            <div class="heading">
            Reflect on how your original wireframes hold up in line with this
            process
          </h3>
            </div>
          <p>
            The whole purpose for this website is to show future employers and
            people of interest the skills I am capable of and to give them a
            brief introduction to who I am. My original wireframes I feel
            provide a good foundation for how I envision my site to be. This
            will obviously change in the coming weeks as I learn more about CSS
            and JavaScript which will play the role of interactive elements and
            responsiveness of the website. I did also see that in my blogs page
            wireframe that there were things that could be improved to make the
            page more appealing to users. The structural layout also aligns well
            with the design principles that I aim for.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <div class="heading">
          <h3>What have I struggled with?</h3>
            </div>
          <p>
            I have struggled with mapping or designing functionality of this
            website across all devices. The goal is to have a responsive and
            aesthetically pleasing design on any device a user plans to open
            this website from, I will however work on this more. Another thing
            that I might have struggled with or took more time to think about
            was my folder structures and how I want them to be easily accessible
            for certain things like for example having separate image folders
            for each index so that it would be more organised. In my wireframes
            I also struggled with having white space in a lot of areas on the
            pages, so space that is not used, which just does not look appealing
            to someone using the website as it’s like wasted space.
          </p>

        <section>
            <div class="heading">
          <h3>What am I proud of?</h3>
            </div>
          <p>
            I would say that I am proud of my knowledge in HTML and getting the
            basic layout of the website down, obviously there was minor
            formatting issues that I just have to remember, and I am excited to
            learn CSS and JavaScript and start making the website come to life.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <div class="heading">
          <h3>What do I want to change going forward?</h3>
            </div>
          <p>
            I want to ensure that my website will stay intuitive. I want to make
            sure that navigation is always clear and easily accessible. I want a
            good balance between the design of the webpage and the core
            functionality of it. Going back to the website being functional on
            all devices I will be looking at many ways to do this in the coming
            weeks to ensure that even with smaller screen the website does not
            lose its functionality and visual aesthetics. I would also like to
            plan for more dynamic elements in my website such as hover effects
            or animations to improve the user experience.
