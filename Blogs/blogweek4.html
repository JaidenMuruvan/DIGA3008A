    <h2>Week 4 – Blog Post</h2>

    <h3>Reflect on how your original wireframes hold up in line with this process</h3>

    <p>
    The whole purpose for this website is to show future employers and people of interest the skills I am capable of and to give them a brief 
    introduction to who I am. My original wireframes I feel provide a good foundation for how I envision my site to be. This will obviously 
    change in the coming weeks as I learn more about CSS and JavaScript which will play the role of interactive elements and responsiveness 
    of the website. I did also see that in my blogs page wireframe that there were things that could be improved to make the page more 
    appealing to users. The structural layout also aligns well with the design principles that I aim for. 
    </p>

    <h3>What have I struggled with?</h3>

    <p>
    I have struggled with mapping or designing functionality of this website across all devices. The goal is to have a responsive and 
    aesthetically pleasing design on any device a user plans to open this website from, I will however work on this more. Another thing 
    that I might have struggled with or took more time to think about was my folder structures and how I want them to be easily accessible 
    for certain things like for example having separate image folders for each index so that it would be more organised. In my wireframes 
    I also struggled with having white space in a lot of areas on the pages, so space that is not used, which just does not look appealing 
    to someone using the website as it’s like wasted space.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What am I proud of?</h3>

    <p>
    I would say that I am proud of my knowledge in HTML and getting the basic layout of the website down, obviously there was minor 
    formatting issues that I just have to remember, and I am excited to learn CSS and JavaScript and start making the website come to life. 
    </p>

    <h3>What do I want to change going forward?</h3>

    <p>
    I want to ensure that my website will stay intuitive. I want to make sure that navigation is always clear and easily accessible. 
    I want a good balance between the design of the webpage and the core functionality of it. Going back to the website being functional 
    on all devices I will be looking at many ways to do this in the coming weeks to ensure that even with smaller screen the website does 
    not lose its functionality and visual aesthetics. I would also like to plan for more dynamic elements in my website such as hover 
    effects or animations to improve the user experience.
