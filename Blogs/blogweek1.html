            <h3>My experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages</h3>
          </div>

          <p>
            It was definitely a different experience to say the least as I have
            never used GitHub for publishing websites before. It does seem like
            a much easier way to publish a website.

              Reflection on the readings I selected - relating it to my
              experience with the internet today
            </h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            Stephan Harper’s 2010 article “As We May Think” at 65 reflects the
            ongoing relevance of Vannevar Bush’s seminal 1945 essay As We May
            Think. Harper basically revisits the ideas from Bush’s original work
            65 years later and indicates how his predictions have taken place in
            computing, hypertext and the internet of today. Bush’s “Memex”
            (which he described as a theoretical device for storing and
            organizing information) is much like todays hyperlinks and
            interconnected web pages. We clearly see this in the way we use
            search engine and databases to navigate huge amounts of knowledge.
            We also see in Harper’s article he outlines a key challenge of there
            being too much information and today’s internet provides an
            overwhelming flood of data making it more difficult to filter and
            use reliable sources.

            The article “Flash And Its History On The Web by Jay Hoffman which
            was published on the 7th of August 2017 explores the evolution of
            Adobe Flash. It was a significant technology in web development and
            this article takes you through the programs journey. The article
            outlines the programs transformation from a graphics editor to
            something that redefined interactivity and design of the internet.
            The history of Flash is a very good example of modern internet
            experiences where web technology evolves, and eventually certain
            programs get replaced by more effective and efficient solutions. The
            reason for it being replaced was because of the end of browser
            plugins where users were required to install a browser plugin which
            became a security risk, and we see with modern browsers it has moved
            away from plugins as a whole.

              Interesting things I have found about the history of the web
            </h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            A very interesting thing that I have come to realised is that
            throughout the years of technology evolving and having many new
            features, it is so important that they continue be updated to fit
            user needs, otherwise as we have seen in today’s time it ends up
            being replaced by more suitable solution. The web has come a long
            way from a simple collection of hyperlinked documents to now a
            massive AI – driven, multimedia experience.

            <h3>My goals for this course.</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            I would like to better my understanding of designing user friendly
            interfaces and interactions that make navigation through them easy
            and enjoyable, and I would like to learn how to analyse and
            interpret user data to measure its effectiveness and adjust or make
            improvements to it.
