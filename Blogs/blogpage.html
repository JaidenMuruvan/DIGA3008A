    <h2> Week 1 – Blog Post </h2>    


    <h3> My experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages </h3>
    
    <p>
    It was definitely a different experience to say the least as I have never used GitHub for publishing websites before. 
    It does seem like a much easier way to publish a website. 
    </p>
    
    <h3> Reflection on the readings I selected - relating it to my experience with the internet today </h3>
    
    <p>
    Stephan Harper’s 2010 article “As We May Think” at 65 reflects the ongoing relevance of Vannevar Bush’s seminal 1945 essay As 
    We May Think. Harper basically revisits the ideas from Bush’s original work 65 years later and indicates how his predictions have 
    taken place in computing, hypertext and the internet of today. Bush’s “Memex” (which he described as a theoretical device for 
    storing and organizing information) is much like todays hyperlinks and interconnected web pages. We clearly see this in the way 
    we use search engine and databases to navigate huge amounts of knowledge. We also see in Harper’s article he outlines a key 
    challenge of there being too much information and today’s internet provides an overwhelming flood of data making it more 
    difficult to filter and use reliable sources.
    </p>

    <p>
    The article “Flash And Its History On The Web by Jay Hoffman which was published on the 7th of August 2017 explores the evolution 
    of Adobe Flash. It was a significant technology in web development and this article takes you through the programs journey. The 
    article outlines the programs transformation from a graphics editor to something that redefined interactivity and design of the 
    internet. The history of Flash is a very good example of modern internet experiences where web technology evolves, and eventually 
    certain programs get replaced by more effective and efficient solutions. The reason for it being replaced was because of the end 
    of browser plugins where users were required to install a browser plugin which became a security risk, and we see with modern 
    browsers it has moved away from plugins as a whole. 
    </p>
    
    <h3> Interesting things I have found about the history of the web </h3>

    <p>
    A very interesting thing that I have come to realised is that throughout the years of technology evolving and having many new 
    features, it is so important that they continue be updated to fit user needs, otherwise as we have seen in today’s time it ends 
    up being replaced by more suitable solution. The web has come a long way from a simple collection of hyperlinked documents to now
    a massive AI – driven, multimedia experience.
    </p>
    
    <h3> My goals for this course. </h3>

    <p>
    I would like to better my understanding of designing user friendly interfaces and interactions that make navigation through them 
    easy and enjoyable, and I would like to learn how to analyse and interpret user data to measure its effectiveness and adjust or 
    make improvements to it.
    </p>

    <h2> Week 2 – Blog Post </h2>
    
    <h3> Reflection on the Reading </h3>
    
    <p>
    Stuart Moulthrop’s text “You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media” reflects on early debates surrounding hypertext and 
    its potential to change reading, writing and media consumption and he also outlines how hypertext was first seen as a disruptive force that 
    challenged traditional linear narratives and hierarchical structures in literature, academia and communication. Moulthrop also connects 
    hypertext to Marshall McLuhan’s “Laws of Media” identifying how new media interacts with and transforms older forms of communication 
    and he does this by also applying McLuhan’s four laws of media and hypertext which are, enhancement, obsolescence, retrieval and reversal. 
    It is evident that Moulthrop is suggesting that hypertext is part of this ongoing cultural evolution which is constantly shaped and 
    impacted by economic, social and political forces. 
    </p>
    
    <h3> How does it speak to the internet today? </h3>
    
    <p>
    This text is still very relevant to the internet of today, considering the issues such as algorithmic control, digital fragmentation 
    and the commercialization of online spaces. We see this in the internet having information easily accessible to us but corporations 
    such as Google or Meta control the majority of what we see through algorithms and targeted advertising, so instead of free-flowing 
    exchange that early hypertext theorists believed in, digital spaces are shaped on economic interests. Moulthrop outlined hypertexts 
    ability that challenged traditional linear narratives which would allow users to explore texts interactively and while the internet 
    has embraced this through hyperlinks, infinite scrolling and algorithmic feeds this has led to fragmented attention and difficulty in 
    deep reading for the user. So instead of reading a single structured argument, users jump between many media such as links, tweets and 
    short form videos making it harder to come to a unified understanding. Moulthrop used the laws of media to predict that hypertext could 
    become way too complex and that is evident in how the modern web is as there is so much of information that leads to people not trusting
    many sources and users finding difficulty in finding credible sources. Hypertext was imagined to be an open system where users would freely find and create links and instead of this AI – driven content feeds now dictate what people consume.

    <h3> Folder structure and URL scheme </h3>
    
    <p>

    I aim to have a clear structure of my folders, so that it is easy to identify and access. 
     
    </p>
    
    <h3> Wireframe </h3>
    
    <p>
    Home: For the home page I would want to have a short introduction to the website and for the different tabs to be easily seen. I would also like to have a button 
    that allows the viewer to see more about the different tabs on the home screen. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Blogs: This tab would be for the weekly blogs that we hand in, I want a preview of what the blog is about before they can view more. For this section I am not so 
    sure how I want it to be setup, as with this current state there is a lot of white space.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Portfolio: This tab will be for extra work that I have done in my own time, so just a page where that is displayed. For this I was thinking a small title and 
    description before, but I am also thinking of that being displayed when the user hovers over the image.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Essays: This tab will be for the essay assignments we will hand in. For this I was thinking to display some part of the essay with its title and then a 
    button to view the whole essay.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Web Design: This tab will be for the process of designing the entire website. This would include the wireframes, style guides and information structure. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    About: This tab will be for more information about me, who I am and what I do as well as contact details and information.
    </p>

    <h3>Reflect on interaction and the www: what interaction means to me </h3>
    
    <p>
    Interaction is the essence of how we engage with the world in digital spaces, such as consuming content and engaging with other users. It is the way we shape and 
    are shaped by the vast networks of information, people and algorithms on the web. The www (World Wide Web) transformed interaction from a passive experience to an 
    active experience where you can directly engage with content through comments, hyperlinks and collaborative platforms. The way we interact on the web is a mirror of 
    how we as individuals engage with others, knowledge and society.

    <h2>Week 3 – Blog Post </h2>

    <h3> User Alignment, Content, Experience and Interface Elements </h3>

    <p>
    User alignment starts with knowing and understanding your target audience as well as my goals with my website overall. My goal 
    is to make a website that feels intuitive, informative and engaging. This links to the user experience and interface which is 
    all about what the users feel when interacting with the website and how the visuals are the interactivity behind it. 
    </p>

    <h3>Sites Content</h3>

    <p>
    Home Tab: This would act as a central hub that would give an overview of the content and features that is available on the 
    website. I want to have quick access links or buttons to other tabs like Blogs, Portfolio, Essays and About. I do not want to 
    make the home page very cluttered which would improve the user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
    Blogs/Essays Tab: This would be layout of discussion boards and assignments which would present thoughts and insights. 
    Each blog or essay would have a captivating image to attract the users attention. There would also be a “Read More” button 
    which would allow the user to access the whole topic. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Portfolio Tab: This would be a showcase of my own work. It would have interactive elements to explore more details. 
    There would be brief descriptions for each thing.
    </p>

    <p>
    About Tab: This page would give more details and information about myself, such as my professional journey, 
    skills and contact information that would be displayed with the help of icons or progress bars.  
    </p>

    <h3> Structure and URL Scheme - How it relates to Semantic Markup </h3>

    <p>
    The exercise emphasizes how we should understand the target audience in order to develop an intuitive, informative and 
    engaging experience. This aligns with semantic markup as it is defined as developing website and creating web content that 
    is meaningful rather than just defining its presentation or look. By knowing how to structure the content around the needs 
    and expectations of users, I can ensure that the website has good functionality and not only visually pleasing. This should 
    also apply in my URL scheme with clear and detailed paths that correspond to each section or each page. Ensuring the websites 
    organization is logical and easy to navigate improves the usability. 
    </p>
    
    <h3> Reflect on Development Progress </h3>

    <p>
    In this week I intend on finding a balance between design and functionality. I want my folder structure in logical 
    sections as well as reflecting on inspirations of websites and remembering user expectations when thinking about the 
    design of the website. In learning about interaction design I want to ensure that information architecture is organised 
    and labelled, the user experience must be practical, useful and user friendly. My user interface must be appealing and 
    easy to ensure intuitive interaction.
    </p>

    <h2>Week 4 – Blog Post</h2>

    <h3>Reflect on how your original wireframes hold up in line with this process</h3>

    <p>
    The whole purpose for this website is to show future employers and people of interest the skills I am capable of and to give them a brief 
    introduction to who I am. My original wireframes I feel provide a good foundation for how I envision my site to be. This will obviously 
    change in the coming weeks as I learn more about CSS and JavaScript which will play the role of interactive elements and responsiveness 
    of the website. I did also see that in my blogs page wireframe that there were things that could be improved to make the page more 
    appealing to users. The structural layout also aligns well with the design principles that I aim for. 
    </p>

    <h3>What have I struggled with?</h3>

    <p>
    I have struggled with mapping or designing functionality of this website across all devices. The goal is to have a responsive and 
    aesthetically pleasing design on any device a user plans to open this website from, I will however work on this more. Another thing 
    that I might have struggled with or took more time to think about was my folder structures and how I want them to be easily accessible 
    for certain things like for example having separate image folders for each index so that it would be more organised. In my wireframes 
    I also struggled with having white space in a lot of areas on the pages, so space that is not used, which just does not look appealing 
    to someone using the website as it’s like wasted space.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What am I proud of?</h3>
I would say that I am proud of my knowledge in HTML and getting the basic layout of the website down, obviously there was minor formatting issues that I just have to remember, and I am excited to learn CSS and JavaScript and start making the website come to life. 

    <h3>What do I want to change going forward?</h3>
I want to ensure that my website will stay intuitive. I want to make sure that navigation is always clear and easily accessible. I want a good balance between the design of the webpage and the core functionality of it. Going back to the website being functional on all devices I will be looking at many ways to do this in the coming weeks to ensure that even with smaller screen the website does not lose its functionality and visual aesthetics. I would also like to plan for more dynamic elements in my website such as hover effects or animations to improve the user experience.
