      <h2>Blog Post 11: Week 14</h2>
      <article class="blog-content">
        <h3>
          How our code matters as developers in the context of decolonialism,
          and identifying things in our own coding practice that we must be
          aware of.
        </h3>

        <p>
          To approach justice and ethics in artistic programming practice I
          believe that its essential to critically engage with the power
          structures, assumptions and impacts of the tools and systems we build.
          Looking at centering community-led design and amplifying marginalized
          voices is crucial to developing inclusive and sustainable solutions.
          This approach involves meaningfully engaging those most impacted by
          social and structural inequities throughout the entire design process,
          from problem identification to implementation and evaluation. By
          prioritizing the lived experience, cultural knowledge and priorities
          of marginalized groups, designers can co-create outcomes that reflect
          the real needs and aspirations of the communities they serve. Such a
          participatory process fosters a trustworthy community and encourages
          long terms ownership of solutions. Design justice challenges
          traditional power dynamics in design by redistributing decision-making
          power and valuing voices historically excluded from dominant
          narratives (Constanza-Chock, 2020). This perspective guides me to
          prioritize inclusive designs where those who are most affected by
          technology have a say in its development. For example, in game design
          or interactive digital art, co-design methods could be implemented
          with users from underrepresented groups and could test for
          accessibility such as screen reader compatibility or
          colourblind-friendly palettes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another approach we can look at is deconstructing digital hegemonies,
          which involves critically examining how power, privilege and
          inequality are embedded within digital technologies, platforms and
          infrastructures. Dominant tech cultures often reflect the values and
          assumptions of a narrow demographic which typically consist of white,
          male, Western and economically privileged marginalizing or excluding
          diverse ways of knowing. This hegemony shapes everything from
          algorithmic bias to platform governance, reinforcing existing social
          hierarchies and limiting access to equitable participation. By
          uncovering and challenging these structures, we open up possibilities
          for alternative and more digital futures. Noble highlights that
          algorithmic systems are not neutral but often perpetuate systemic
          racism and other forms of oppression under the guise of objectivity,
          making critical engagement with digital power structures essential
          (Noble, 2018). This reminds us that algorithms can be looked at as not
          neutral and often replicate geopolitical biases and commercial
          interests. As a developer I think especially looking at it from a
          justice and ethical standpoint, making searchability, data
          representation and information architecture more equitable and
          transparently disclosing algorithmic decision making where applicable
          will all ensure a better programming practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ensuring ethical practice involves recognizing that digital justice is
          not just about what we create but also about who can use and benefit
          from it. Bridging the digital divide requires more than just simply
          providing access to devices or internet connectivity, it also involves
          addressing the deeper socio-economic, educational and infrastructural
          inequalities that limit meaningful digital participation. Marginalized
          communities often face barriers not only to access but also to digital
          literacy, cultural relevance and content creation. Efforts to bridge
          this divide must be community-informed and context specific, ensuring
          that technology serves as a tool for empowerment rather than a
          reinforcer of existing inequities. Digital inclusion must be
          understood as a social and political challenge, not just a technical
          one, demanding policies and practices that center equity, justice and
          sustainability in digital access and use (Selwyn, 2010). In our work
          as developers this means supporting open source and free access and
          avoiding platform lock in that marginalizes users with limited
          hardware or connectivity.
