    <h2>Week 3 – Blog Post </h2>

    <h3> User Alignment, Content, Experience and Interface Elements </h3>

    <p>
    User alignment starts with knowing and understanding your target audience as well as my goals with my website overall. My goal 
    is to make a website that feels intuitive, informative and engaging. This links to the user experience and interface which is 
    all about what the users feel when interacting with the website and how the visuals are the interactivity behind it. 
    </p>

    <h3>Sites Content</h3>

    <p>
    Home Tab: This would act as a central hub that would give an overview of the content and features that is available on the 
    website. I want to have quick access links or buttons to other tabs like Blogs, Portfolio, Essays and About. I do not want to 
    make the home page very cluttered which would improve the user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
    Blogs/Essays Tab: This would be layout of discussion boards and assignments which would present thoughts and insights. 
    Each blog or essay would have a captivating image to attract the users attention. There would also be a “Read More” button 
    which would allow the user to access the whole topic. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Portfolio Tab: This would be a showcase of my own work. It would have interactive elements to explore more details. 
    There would be brief descriptions for each thing.
    </p>

    <p>
    About Tab: This page would give more details and information about myself, such as my professional journey, 
    skills and contact information that would be displayed with the help of icons or progress bars.  
    </p>

    <h3> Structure and URL Scheme - How it relates to Semantic Markup </h3>

    <p>
    The exercise emphasizes how we should understand the target audience in order to develop an intuitive, informative and 
    engaging experience. This aligns with semantic markup as it is defined as developing website and creating web content that 
    is meaningful rather than just defining its presentation or look. By knowing how to structure the content around the needs 
    and expectations of users, I can ensure that the website has good functionality and not only visually pleasing. This should 
    also apply in my URL scheme with clear and detailed paths that correspond to each section or each page. Ensuring the websites 
    organization is logical and easy to navigate improves the usability. 
    </p>
    
    <h3> Reflect on Development Progress </h3>

    <p>
    In this week I intend on finding a balance between design and functionality. I want my folder structure in logical 
    sections as well as reflecting on inspirations of websites and remembering user expectations when thinking about the 
    design of the website. In learning about interaction design I want to ensure that information architecture is organised 
    and labelled, the user experience must be practical, useful and user friendly. My user interface must be appealing and 
    easy to ensure intuitive interaction.
