      <h2>Week 3 – Blog Post</h2>

      <article class="blog-content">
        <section>
          <div class="heading">
            <h3>User Alignment, Content, Experience and Interface Elements</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            User alignment starts with knowing and understanding your target
            audience as well as my goals with my website overall. My goal is to
            make a website that feels intuitive, informative and engaging. This
            links to the user experience and interface which is all about what
            the users feel when interacting with the website and how the visuals
            are the interactivity behind it.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <div class="heading">
            <h3>Sites Content</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            Home Tab: This would act as a central hub that would give an
            overview of the content and features that is available on the
            website. I want to have quick access links or buttons to other tabs
            like Blogs, Portfolio, Essays and About. I do not want to make the
            home page very cluttered which would improve the user experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Blogs/Essays Tab: This would be layout of discussion boards and
            assignments which would present thoughts and insights. Each blog or
            essay would have a captivating image to attract the users attention.
            There would also be a “Read More” button which would allow the user
            to access the whole topic.
          </p>

          <p>
            Portfolio Tab: This would be a showcase of my own work. It would
            have interactive elements to explore more details. There would be
            brief descriptions for each thing.
          </p>

          <p>
            About Tab: This page would give more details and information about
            myself, such as my professional journey, skills and contact
            information that would be displayed with the help of icons or
            progress bars.
          </p>

        <section>
          <div class="heading">
            <h3>
              Structure and URL Scheme - How it relates to Semantic Markup
            </h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            The exercise emphasizes how we should understand the target audience
            in order to develop an intuitive, informative and engaging
            experience. This aligns with semantic markup as it is defined as
            developing website and creating web content that is meaningful
            rather than just defining its presentation or look. By knowing how
            to structure the content around the needs and expectations of users,
            I can ensure that the website has good functionality and not only
            visually pleasing. This should also apply in my URL scheme with
            clear and detailed paths that correspond to each section or each
            page. Ensuring the websites organization is logical and easy to
            navigate improves the usability.

            <h3>Reflect on Development Progress</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            In this week I intend on finding a balance between design and
            functionality. I want my folder structure in logical sections as
            well as reflecting on inspirations of websites and remembering user
            expectations when thinking about the design of the website. In
            learning about interaction design I want to ensure that information
            architecture is organised and labelled, the user experience must be
            practical, useful and user friendly. My user interface must be
            appealing and easy to ensure intuitive interaction.
