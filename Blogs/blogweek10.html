      <h3>“Internet Access is a Fundamental Right” by S. Kasapis (2020)</h3>
      
    <p>
        In the article “Internet Access is a Fundamental Right,” Kasapis presents an ethically charged argument that 
        puts internet access not merely as a luxury or convenience but more a fundamental human right essential for 
        participation in modern life. Through a mix of philosophical reasoning, references to legal precedent and social 
        justice discourse, this article urges both the governments and global institutions to recognize internet access as 
        vital for democratic participation, education and equality (Kasapis, 2020). From the start of the article, Kasapis 
        anchors the discussion in moral and legal frameworks, drawing parallels between internet access and other socio-economic 
        rights such as education, healthcare and housing. In doing so the author aligns with the broader tradition of rights-based 
        discourse, emphasizing that the digital divide amplifies existing inequalities. It also takes a normative approach in 
        suggesting that digital exclusion results in a social exclusion, reinforcing cycles of poverty and marginalization (Kasapis, 2020).
    </p>

    <p>
        A key strength of the article lies in its global perspective. Kasapis uses examples ranging from UN declarations 
        to national court rulings such as the 2016 ruling by the UN Human Rights Counsil that condemned intentional 
        internet disruptions, which reinforces the argument that digital access is increasingly being recognised as 
        essential to exercising freedoms of expression, assembly and information. This interlinking of rights underpins 
        the authors thesis that internet access is a gateway right, one that enables the realization of many others. 
        Another element is the articles attention to contemporary relevance. Since it was published in the year 2020, 
        it echoes the heightened urgency brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, during which online access became a lifeline 
        for education, work, healthcare and even civic engagement (Kasapis, 2020). Kasapis uses this context not only to 
        illustrate the practical importance of connectivity but to also challenge outdated conceptions of infrastructure. 
        The author argues that the internet should be treated like electricity or water, which is a public utility essential 
        for modern citizenship (Kasapis, 2020).
    </p>

    <p>
        However, Kasapis does not stop at the diagnosis, but this article also includes policy recommendations 
        urging government to invest in broadband infrastructure, specifically in rural and underserved or less fortunate 
        communities, treating internet access as part of a universal service obligation. There is also a subtle critique of 
        market driven models, which the author suggests have failed to equitably distribute digital resources, reinforcing 
        structural inequalities. In terms of tone and rhetoric, this article is persuasive yet measured relying more on 
        logical reasoning and legal precedent than emotional appeal. The clarity of structure, problem, justification, 
        evidence, solution all enhances it persuasiveness. Kasapis writes this article not just as an advocate, but as 
        a scholar engaging seriously with ethical and legal dimensions of digital life.
    </p>

    <p>
        This article is a compelling contribution to ongoing debates about digital rights and justice. By positioning 
        internet access as a fundamental in fully participating in society, Kasapis challenges policymakers to rethink 
        infrastructure, equality and citizenship in the digital age. The piece serves as both a call to action and a 
        moral blueprint for how societies might bridge the digital divide in more just and sustainable ways (Kasapis, 2020).
