      <h3>"Digital Inequalities in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data" by Christoph Lutz (2019)</h3>
      
    <p>
        This article by Christoph Lutz provides a timely and nuanced examination of how artificial intelligence or AI, 
        and big data technologies intersect with and exacerbate existing digital inequalities. What makes this article 
        particularly compelling is its move beyond the traditional “digital divide” framework focusing largely on access 
        toward a more sophisticated understanding of usage, literacy and power asymmetries. This shift is crucial in an 
        era where access to digital tools is increasingly widespread, but the ability to meaningfully engage with and 
        benefit from these technologies remains unevenly distributed (Lutz, 2019). One of the articles strengths is shown 
        in how Lutz highlights how algorithmic systems and data driven technologies can reproduce and even deepen social 
        biases, making these systems and technologies not neutral. Lutz effectively draws attention to the ways in which 
        AI applications, often perceived as neutral or objective, may embed discrimination, specifically against certain 
        groups due to biased training data studies that technological advancements do not inherently lead to fairer or 
        more democratic societies. The article contributes to a growing body of literature concerned with the ethical and 
        social implications of algorithmic governance (Eubank, 2018).
    </p>

        A key strength of the article lies in its global perspective. Kasapis uses examples ranging from UN declarations 
        to national court rulings such as the 2016 ruling by the UN Human Rights Counsil that condemned intentional 
        internet disruptions, which reinforces the argument that digital access is increasingly being recognised as 
        essential to exercising freedoms of expression, assembly and information. This interlinking of rights underpins 
        the authors thesis that internet access is a gateway right, one that enables the realization of many others. 
        Another element is the articles attention to contemporary relevance. Since it was published in the year 2020, 
        it echoes the heightened urgency brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, during which online access became a lifeline 
        for education, work, healthcare and even civic engagement (Kasapis, 2020). Kasapis uses this context not only to 
        illustrate the practical importance of connectivity but to also challenge outdated conceptions of infrastructure. 
        The author argues that the internet should be treated like electricity or water, which is a public utility essential 
        for modern citizenship (Kasapis, 2020).
    </p>

        While this article presents a strong conceptual framework it could benefit from more empirical grounding. 
        Many of the claims about AI-related inequalities are valid but remain abstract. Case studies or real-world 
        examples such as algorithmic bias in credit scoring, predictive policing or employment would have made the 
        argument more tangible and impactful. Similarly, while the call for improved digital literacy and public 
        policy interventions is persuasive, there is little exploration of what successful interventions might look 
        like or how they could be implemented in practice. Another part that could be expanded is the global perspective. 
        Much of the discussion seems implicitly centered Western or developed countries, where digital infrastructure is 
        well established. It does not substantially engage with how digital inequalities manifest in the Global South, 
        where disparities in access and usage are often far more severe and connected with issues of surveillance, colonialism, 
        and resource scarcity (Couldry & Mejias, 2019). A more global lens would have enriched the discussion and acknowledged 
        the uneven geographies of AI development and deployment. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, while Lutz rightly calls for greater digital literacy and public policy engagement , the article remains 
        somewhat vague on specific solutions. Lutz article makes a valuable contribution by reframing digital inequalities
         within the context of AI and big data. It serves as a call to action for scholars, policymakers and technologists 
         to rethink how we build and govern these technologies, not just for efficiency or profit but with equity and justice 
         at the core. Future research could build on this work by exploring practical, interdisciplinary interventions aimed 
         at promoting algorithmic accountability and equitable digital participation. As AI systems become more embedded in 
         everyday life, these concerns will only grow in importance.
