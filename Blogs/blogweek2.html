    <h2> Week 2 – Blog Post </h2>

    <h3> Reflection on the Reading </h3>
    
    <p>
    Stuart Moulthrop’s text “You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media” reflects on early debates surrounding hypertext and 
    its potential to change reading, writing and media consumption and he also outlines how hypertext was first seen as a disruptive force that 
    challenged traditional linear narratives and hierarchical structures in literature, academia and communication. Moulthrop also connects 
    hypertext to Marshall McLuhan’s “Laws of Media” identifying how new media interacts with and transforms older forms of communication 
    and he does this by also applying McLuhan’s four laws of media and hypertext which are, enhancement, obsolescence, retrieval and reversal. 
    It is evident that Moulthrop is suggesting that hypertext is part of this ongoing cultural evolution which is constantly shaped and 
    impacted by economic, social and political forces.

    <h3> How does it speak to the internet today? </h3>
    
    <p>
    This text is still very relevant to the internet of today, considering the issues such as algorithmic control, digital fragmentation 
    and the commercialization of online spaces. We see this in the internet having information easily accessible to us but corporations 
    such as Google or Meta control the majority of what we see through algorithms and targeted advertising, so instead of free-flowing 
    exchange that early hypertext theorists believed in, digital spaces are shaped on economic interests. Moulthrop outlined hypertexts 
    ability that challenged traditional linear narratives which would allow users to explore texts interactively and while the internet 
    has embraced this through hyperlinks, infinite scrolling and algorithmic feeds this has led to fragmented attention and difficulty in 
    deep reading for the user. So instead of reading a single structured argument, users jump between many media such as links, tweets and 
    short form videos making it harder to come to a unified understanding. Moulthrop used the laws of media to predict that hypertext could 
    become way too complex and that is evident in how the modern web is as there is so much of information that leads to people not trusting
    many sources and users finding difficulty in finding credible sources. Hypertext was imagined to be an open system where users would freely find and create links and instead of this AI – driven content feeds now dictate what people consume.

    <h3> Folder structure and URL scheme </h3>
    
    <p>

    I aim to have a clear structure of my folders, so that it is easy to identify and access.

    <h3> Wireframe </h3>
    
    <p>
    Home: For the home page I would want to have a short introduction to the website and for the different tabs to be easily seen. I would also like to have a button 
    that allows the viewer to see more about the different tabs on the home screen. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Blogs: This tab would be for the weekly blogs that we hand in, I want a preview of what the blog is about before they can view more. For this section I am not so 
    sure how I want it to be setup, as with this current state there is a lot of white space.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Portfolio: This tab will be for extra work that I have done in my own time, so just a page where that is displayed. For this I was thinking a small title and 
    description before, but I am also thinking of that being displayed when the user hovers over the image.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Essays: This tab will be for the essay assignments we will hand in. For this I was thinking to display some part of the essay with its title and then a 
    button to view the whole essay.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Web Design: This tab will be for the process of designing the entire website. This would include the wireframes, style guides and information structure. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    About: This tab will be for more information about me, who I am and what I do as well as contact details and information.

    <h3>Reflect on interaction and the www: what interaction means to me </h3>
    
    <p>
    Interaction is the essence of how we engage with the world in digital spaces, such as consuming content and engaging with other users. It is the way we shape and 
    are shaped by the vast networks of information, people and algorithms on the web. The www (World Wide Web) transformed interaction from a passive experience to an 
    active experience where you can directly engage with content through comments, hyperlinks and collaborative platforms. The way we interact on the web is a mirror of 
    how we as individuals engage with others, knowledge and society.
