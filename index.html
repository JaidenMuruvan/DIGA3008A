    Week 1 – Blog Post

•	My experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages

It was definitely a different experience to say the least as I have never used GitHub for publishing websites before. It does seem like a much easier way to publish a website. 

•	Reflection on the readings I selected - relating it to my experience with the internet today

Stephan Harper’s 2010 article “As We May Think” at 65 reflects the ongoing relevance of Vannevar Bush’s seminal 1945 essay As We May Think. Harper basically revisits the ideas from Bush’s original work 65 years later and indicates how his predictions have taken place in computing, hypertext and the internet of today. Bush’s “Memex” (which he described as a theoretical device for storing and organizing information) is much like todays hyperlinks and interconnected web pages. We clearly see this in the way we use search engine and databases to navigate huge amounts of knowledge. We also see in Harper’s article he outlines a key challenge of there being too much information and today’s internet provides an overwhelming flood of data making it more difficult to filter and use reliable sources.
The article “Flash And Its History On The Web by Jay Hoffman which was published on the 7th of August 2017 explores the evolution of Adobe Flash. It was a significant technology in web development and this article takes you through the programs journey. The article outlines the programs transformation from a graphics editor to something that redefined interactivity and design of the internet. The history of Flash is a very good example of modern internet experiences where web technology evolves, and eventually certain programs get replaced by more effective and efficient solutions. The reason for it being replaced was because of the end of browser plugins where users were required to install a browser plugin which became a security risk, and we see with modern browsers it has moved away from plugins as a whole. 

•	Interesting things I have found about the history of the web

A very interesting thing that I have come to realised is that throughout the years of technology evolving and having many new features, it is so important that they continue be updated to fit user needs, otherwise as we have seen in today’s time it ends up being replaced by more suitable solution. The web has come a long way from a simple collection of hyperlinked documents to now a massive AI – driven, multimedia experience. 

•	My goals for this course.

I would like to better my understanding of designing user friendly interfaces and interactions that make navigation through them easy and enjoyable, and I would like to learn how to analyse and interpret user data to measure its effectiveness and adjust or make improvements to it.
