<b><big>•	My experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages </big></b>

<p>
It was definitely a different experience to say the least as I have never used GitHub for publishing websites before. 
It does seem like a much easier way to publish a website. 
</p>

<b><big>•	Reflection on the readings I selected - relating it to my experience with the internet today </big></b>

<p>
Stephan Harper’s 2010 article “As We May Think” at 65 reflects the ongoing relevance of Vannevar Bush’s seminal 1945 essay As 
We May Think. Harper basically revisits the ideas from Bush’s original work 65 years later and indicates how his predictions have 
taken place in computing, hypertext and the internet of today. Bush’s “Memex” (which he described as a theoretical device for 
storing and organizing information) is much like todays hyperlinks and interconnected web pages. We clearly see this in the way 
we use search engine and databases to navigate huge amounts of knowledge. We also see in Harper’s article he outlines a key 
challenge of there being too much information and today’s internet provides an overwhelming flood of data making it more 
difficult to filter and use reliable sources.<br/>
The article “Flash And Its History On The Web by Jay Hoffman which was published on the 7th of August 2017 explores the evolution 
of Adobe Flash. It was a significant technology in web development and this article takes you through the programs journey. The 
article outlines the programs transformation from a graphics editor to something that redefined interactivity and design of the 
internet. The history of Flash is a very good example of modern internet experiences where web technology evolves, and eventually 
certain programs get replaced by more effective and efficient solutions. The reason for it being replaced was because of the end 
of browser plugins where users were required to install a browser plugin which became a security risk, and we see with modern 
browsers it has moved away from plugins as a whole.

<b><big>•	Interesting things I have found about the history of the web </big></b>
<p>
A very interesting thing that I have come to realised is that throughout the years of technology evolving and having many new 
features, it is so important that they continue be updated to fit user needs, otherwise as we have seen in today’s time it ends 
up being replaced by more suitable solution. The web has come a long way from a simple collection of hyperlinked documents to now
a massive AI – driven, multimedia experience.
</p>

<b><big>•	My goals for this course. </big></b>
<p>
I would like to better my understanding of designing user friendly interfaces and interactions that make navigation through them 
easy and enjoyable, and I would like to learn how to analyse and interpret user data to measure its effectiveness and adjust or 
make improvements to it.

<u><h1>Week 2 – Blog Post</h1></u></br>

<b><big>•	Reflection on the Reading </big></b>

<p>
Stuart Moulthrop’s text “You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media” reflects on early debates surrounding hypertext and its potential to change 
reading, writing and media consumption and he also outlines how hypertext was first seen as a disruptive force that challenged traditional linear narratives and 
hierarchical structures in literature, academia and communication. Moulthrop also connects hypertext to Marshall McLuhan’s “Laws of Media” identifying how new 
media interacts with and transforms older forms of communication and he does this by also applying McLuhan’s four laws of media and hypertext which are, enhancement,
obsolescence, retrieval and reversal. It is evident that Moulthrop is suggesting that hypertext is part of this ongoing cultural evolution which is constantly 
shaped and impacted by economic, social and political forces. 
</p>

<b><big>•	How does it speak to the internet today? </big></b>

<p>
This text is still very relevant to the internet of today, considering the issues such as algorithmic control, digital fragmentation and the commercialization of 
online spaces. We see this in the internet having information easily accessible to us but corporations such as Google or Meta control the majority of what we see 
through algorithms and targeted advertising, so instead of free-flowing exchange that early hypertext theorists believed in, digital spaces are shaped on economic 
interests. Moulthrop outlined hypertexts ability that challenged traditional linear narratives which would allow users to explore texts interactively and while the 
internet has embraced this through hyperlinks, infinite scrolling and algorithmic feeds this has led to fragmented attention and difficulty in deep reading for the 
user. So instead of reading a single structured argument, users jump between many media such as links, tweets and short form videos making it harder to come to a 
unified understanding. Moulthrop used the laws of media to predict that hypertext could become way too complex and that is evident in how the modern web is as there 
is so much of information that leads to people not trusting many sources and users finding difficulty in finding credible sources. Hypertext was imagined to be an 
open system where users would freely find and create links and instead of this AI – driven content feeds now dictate what people consume.

<b><big>•	Folder structure and URL scheme </big></b>

<p>I aim to have a clear structure of my folders, so that it is easy to identify and access. </p>

<b><big>•	Wireframe </big></b>

<p>
Home: For the home page I would want to have a short introduction to the website and for the different tabs to be easily seen. I would also like to have a button 
that allows the viewer to see more about the different tabs on the home screen. 
</p>

<p>
Blogs: This tab would be for the weekly blogs that we hand in, I want a preview of what the blog is about before they can view more. For this section I am not so 
sure how I want it to be setup, as with this current state there is a lot of white space.
</p>

<p>
Portfolio: This tab will be for extra work that I have done in my own time, so just a page where that is displayed. For this I was thinking a small title and 
description before, but I am also thinking of that being displayed when the user hovers over the image.
</p>

<p>
Essays: This tab will be for the essay assignments we will hand in. For this I was thinking to display some part of the essay with its title and then a 
button to view the whole essay.
</p>

<p>
Web Design: This tab will be for the process of designing the entire website. This would include the wireframes, style guides and information structure. 
</p>

<p>
About: This tab will be for more information about me, who I am and what I do as well as contact details and information.

<b><big>•	Reflect on interaction and the www: what interaction means to me </big></b>

<p>
Interaction is the essence of how we engage with the world in digital spaces, such as consuming content and engaging with other users. It is the way we shape and 
are shaped by the vast networks of information, people and algorithms on the web. The www (World Wide Web) transformed interaction from a passive experience to an 
active experience where you can directly engage with content through comments, hyperlinks and collaborative platforms. The way we interact on the web is a mirror of 
how we as individuals engage with others, knowledge and society.
