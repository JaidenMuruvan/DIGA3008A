      <h2>Essay 2: The internet, geopolitics, and digital coloniality</h2>
      <article class="essay-content">
        <h3>AWS’s Expansion into Kenya’s Cloud Ecosystem</h3>
        <p>
          In a growing interconnected world where the internet is often looked
          at as a neutral, democratizing force while beneath the surface lies a
          complex geopolitical web where digital infrastructures, data and
          algorithmic systems are all shaped by and reinforce existing global
          power structures. Many scholars of digital colonialism have argued
          that control over internet infrastructure and data governance mirror
          colonial logics of extraction and dependence. This essay explores
          these dynamics through the case study of the Amazon Web Services’ or
          AWS expansion into Kenya in 2024. I will be drawing from readings by
          Birhane, Graham and many others from the course readings as well as
          draw from my own sources to help this essay analyse how AWS’s presence
          in Kenya reflects broader patterns of digital coloniality and
          structural inequality in the internet age.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the year 2024 AWS launched a new Local Zone in Nairobi which marked
          a significant expansion of its infrastructure in Africa. According to
          reports by TechCrunch in 2024, the move was marketed as a step towards
          improving latency and accessibility for Kenyan businesses and
          developers (TechCrunch, 2024). Kenyan officials had also celebrated
          the launch as a boost for digital transformation, citing its potential
          to enhance local innovation and economic growth. However, this
          narrative of digital development obscures deeper concerns around
          sovereignty, dependency and control. Although the infrastructure is
          physically based in Kenya, AWS retains ownership, technical governance
          and control over data flows which appears to empower but it actually
          in fact integrates Kenya more tightly into a global cloud ecosystem
          which is dominated by U.S. based corporations.
        </p>

        <p>
          AWS’s expansion is a contemporary manifestation of the imposition of
          Western data and AI infrastructure in African contexts without mutual
          investment in local autonomy or knowledge systems which is known as
          “algorithmic colonization” or as the author Birhane explains it
          (Birhane, 2020). Just as colonial powers once extracted raw materials
          from African soil, modern tech corporations extract data, labour and
          economic value through digital infrastructures which maintains control
          while still leaving a little room for local ownership or governance.
          Viewing Keyna’s cloud infrastructure in this light shows us that it is
          not a sign of digital liberation but a sign of a deep entanglement in
          techno-colonial systems. The AWS Local Zone offers improved access but
          does not empower Kenya to shape the terms of digital engagement, which
          includes decisions about data storage, algorithmic standards, and
          platform policies all remaining externally governed. This means that
          colonialism persists not through direct rule, but through
          infrastructural and algorithmic dependence (Birhane, 2020).
        </p>

        <p>
          The reading “Internet Geographies” by Graham helps to explain how
          global digital power is unevenly distributed. The author argues that
          while internet is often assumed to be spatially neutral, it in fact
          privileges certain locations, typically in the global North through
          their infrastructural concentration, data centralization and network
          hierarchies. Through this view, Kenya’s new data center does not
          decentralize digital power, but it merely serves as a peripheral node
          in a larger network controlled from abroad. The term “Local Zone” is
          actually misleading as AWS promotes this illusion of local
          infrastructure, yet the center’s governance, software and economic
          benefits remain in the United States. Kenyan developers may experience
          benefits from having better latency resulting in faster load times,
          but they are still locked into Amazon’s proprietary systems which in
          the end limits their capacity to develop independent digital
          ecosystems. Furthermore, the placement of data infrastructure in Kenya
          is not simply a matter of technological logistics but it is a
          geopolitical decision. AWS’s expansion represents a strategic move to
          cement influence in African digital markets that are ahead of
          competitors like Huawei or Alibaba also reinforcing U.S digital
          hegemony through corporate proxies.
        </p>

        <p>
          While AWS’s infrastructure may technically reduce barriers around
          digital access, it falls short in addressing deeper forms of digital
          inequality. In the reading “Digital inequalities in the age of
          artificial intelligence and big data” written by Christoph Lutz, it is
          explained that digital inequality is not only whether people can
          access technology, but also about how they can use it meaningfully and
          participate in shaping its development (Lutz, 2019). In Kenya, the AWS
          Local Zone may improve service speeds for tech companies, but ordinary
          citizens still remain excluded from decisions about how their data is
          stored, processed or even monetized. The knowledge required to build
          and govern such infrastructures remain concentrated in the Global
          North meaning that most Kenyan developers and policymakers must rely
          on foreign expertise to maintain and optimize these systems. This in
          turn reinforces the “third level” of the digital divide which is the
          ability to produce content and control infrastructure (Ruiu and
          Ragnedda, 2017). AWS’s dominance also undermines Kenya’s potential to
          cultivate its own open-source or regionally developed platforms. Local
          alternatives actually struggle to compete with the scale, funding and
          brand recognition of Amazon which deepens their dependency and reduces
          the innovation capacity within the region.

        />
        <p>
          A key feature of digital coloniality is its ability to frame dominance
          as generosity. Giorgos Verdi explains that technocolonialism operates
          by presenting extractive or controlling systems as developmental
          opportunities (Verdi, 2020). AWS’s expansion in Kenya was widely
          reported in glowing terms by local and international media, often
          repeating Amazon’s own press language without critical analysis.
          Social media responses were similarly celebratory with Kenyan tech
          influences who applauded the move claiming it as a step towards
          modernization. Although this celebratory discourse masks the
          structural inequalities embedded in such partnerships as AWS reaps
          substantial commercial benefits while Kenya takes on the
          infrastructure and regulatory risks. There is also very little public
          discussion about long-term data sovereignty, cybersecurity
          implications or the risk of monopolistic entrenchment in local digital
          markets. This reflects a broader pattern of digital hegemony, where
          global platforms maintain control over how knowledge is organized,
          accessed and monetized cross geographies (Ballatore et al., 2017).
          This is far from being neutral intermediaries and companies like AWS
          are actively shaping how the internet works in Kenya, which influences
          everything from software compatibility to the architecture of digital
          services.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this the question asked is, “What alternatives are there to this
          dynamic of digital colonialism?” It is argued in “Making a Feminist
          Internet in Africa” by Magenya, that building a feminist internet in
          Africa requires rethinking infrastructure, ownership and epistemology
          from the ground up (Magenya, 2020). To achieve this, it means that
          there must be an empowering over local communities to control their
          own data, develop regional appropriate platforms and resist the
          normalization of foreign dominance in digital development. In this
          specific context this could involve supporting public and
          community-run data centers which allows for investment within
          open-source technologies and promoting legal frameworks that protect
          data sovereignty. This also means fostering critical media literacy so
          that digital partnerships are evaluated not just for their technical
          benefits but for their geopolitical and ethical implications. A truly
          independent digital future for Kenya and other African nations will
          not most definitely not be achieved by hosting the servers of global
          tech giants but it will require new models of collaboration,
          innovation and governance rooted in justice, autonomy and decolonial
          thinking.
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion AWS’s 2024 expansion into Kenya faces many complex
          intersections between internet infrastructure, geopolitics and digital
          coloniality. While promising development and access it is evident that
          this move rather entrenches Kenya’s dependence on foreign
          infrastructure and governance, showing us patterns of inequality
          rooted in historical colonial systems. Though the lens of critical
          internet geographies, digital inequality theory and decolonial AI
          frameworks, we can understand this development as not purely a
          technical evolution, but as a deeply political act. Rather than
          accepting digital integration as inherently beneficial we must ask
          questions such as, who will build the internet, who will control it
          and who exactly will benefit from it? It is only by addressing these
          questions that we will be able to imagine a more independent digital
          future.
