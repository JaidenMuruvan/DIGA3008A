      <h2>Essay 3: The Final Reflection</h2>
      <article class="essay-content">
        <h3>My Final Reflection on the Implementation of My Website</h3>
        <p>
          Developing my website has definitely been an interesting and iterative
          journey that revealed the relationship between structure, design, and
          functionality. What started as a basic site with scattered files and
          inconsistent styling evolved into a well-organised, maintainable, and
          user-focused project. Through ongoing feedback and testing, I tried to
          refine every component, from the folder structure and semantic HTML to
          responsive layouts and interactive JavaScript features. This
          reflection outlines the technical decisions behind the site’s
          development, explaining how design choices influenced the code and how
          each element such as the structure, semantics, metadata, CSS,
          JavaScript, and UI/UX all contributed to the final product.
        </p>

        <h3>Folder Structure</h3>
        <p>
          Folder Structure Initially, my project suffered from a cluttered file
          structure, with each HTML page linked to its own CSS file. This setup
          made the site difficult to maintain and scale. After receiving
          feedback, I reorganised the site’s architecture to better reflect its
          content and functionality. I introduced a clear hierarchy, with
          dedicated folders for Blogs, Design, Essays, Portfolio, and
          HomeImages. This restructuring enhanced both developer workflow and
          user navigation. To then further streamline the site, I consolidated
          redundant stylesheets into a single blog.css file, since all the Blog
          Weeks sections share similar layouts. This eliminated repetition and
          simplified updates. I also standardised file and class names using
          camelCase conventions for greater consistency across the project.
        </p>

        <h3>Semantic Markup</h3>
        <p>
          My website uses semantic HTML elements such as header, main, footer,
          article, and section to give the content meaningful structure. Each
          blog and essay are wrapped in an article to indicate standalone
          content, while related content is grouped within section tags. I
          maintained a logical heading hierarchy throughout to improve
          readability for assistive technologies and support better indexing by
          search engines.
        </p>

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>
          When styling the website, I focused on writing clean, modular, and
          scalable CSS. I avoided inline styles, relying instead on external
          stylesheets to centralise and manage all visual rules. Ensuring that
          there are reusable classes across all pages. To keep things organised,
          I divided the CSS into separate files by functionality for example,
          portfolio.css handles styles specific to the Portfolio page, which
          differs from other sections. I also tried to implement responsive
          design using media queries to adapt the layout for different screen
          sizes.
        </p>
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript plays a key role in improving interactivity and enhancing
          user experience. I implemented features such as a back-to-top button,
          smooth scrolling to sections, as well as a dark mode which all uses
          event listeners and DOM manipulation. Subtle animations between blog
          posts added a polished feel. My favourite implementation in JS is the
          API allowing users to search and watch their favourite shows. If
          expanded, I’d explore using asynchronous data fetching to reduce page
          reloads and improve performance.
        </p>
        <h3>UI/UX and Code Interplay</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout development, I realised how deeply user interface and
          experience choices influence the underlying code. Visual features like
          theme switching, hover effects, and responsive layouts required
          careful coordination between CSS and JavaScript. This experience
          taught me that balancing visual polish with maintainable code is
          crucial. In future iterations, I would refactor repetitive styles,
          document design patterns more thoroughly, and prioritise accessibility
          testing to ensure the code grows alongside the UI.
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion, this website underscored the importance of structure,
          clarity, and user experience in web development. By refining the
          folder organisation, applying semantic HTML, and optimising CSS and
          JavaScript, I enhanced both the usability and maintainability of the
          website. Features like responsive design, theme switching, and
          microformats boosted accessibility and SEO. While the site functions
          well, it also highlighted areas for improvement, such as code
          scalability and reuse. Overall, the process deepened my technical
          understanding and reinforced the value of writing clean, efficient,
          and thoughtful code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, in analysing the UI and UX of the Makro website through the
          lens of ethical design, accessibility, navigation structure and
          user-centred principles it becomes clear that while the site meets
          functional standards, there is definitely areas for improvement. It
          would significantly benefit the website if these ethical gaps were
          addressed to enhance navigation, responsiveness, trust within the
          user, accessibility and user prioritization. Makro’s website has a
          strong foundation and must commit to a more ethical, inclusive and
          human-centred design approach to ensure that all users, regardless of
          ability, background or intent, can navigate and interact with its
          platform easily and effectively.
