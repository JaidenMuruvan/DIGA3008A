      <h2>Essay 1: UX & UI Analysis</h2>
      <article class="essay-content">
        <h3>UX & UI Analysis of Makro</h3>
        <p>
          Makro, a large wholesale and retail company that operates both
          physical stores and an e-commerce platform, serving customers
          primarily in South Africa and parts of southern Africa. This website
          is designed to support both individual consumers and business buyers,
          offering a wide range of products. The products range from electronics
          and appliances to groceries, office supplies and even liquor. In this
          essay I will be analysing the websites UI and UX and keep in mind that
          ethical website design is not just about doing the right thing,
          instead it’s about sustaining a successful and positive user
          relationship (Ghanchi, 2021).
        </p>

        <p>
          The websites navigation bar is consistent at the top of every page
          which features a top horizontal menu with dropdown options for main
          categories. It is clear and categorized into product types with their
          wide range of products and these filtering options helps to refine
          users searches which is very helpful for users to quickly and easily
          find what they need. This can also become very overwhelming to the
          user due to the volume of options displayed simultaneously and the
          amount of categories and subcategories which makes it difficult to
          make quick decisions. On a mobile device some menus and drops can
          become difficult to interact with which then affects the ease of use
          and the responsiveness of the website. A clear and well-structured
          primary navigation system is essential to help users locate their
          goals efficiently without cognitive overload (Torresburriel Estudio,
          2024). The navigation is generally intuitive and allows for users to
          freely browse and search through a large range of categories which all
          in all supports the user autonomy.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the presence of frequent promotional popups and visually
          dominant banners may push users toward certain products, which can
          count as a manipulative design which is also a concern outlined by
          Ghanchi as a violation of user trust (Ghanchi, 2021). The hamburger
          menu functions adequately on mobile but there is room for improvement
          on usability by introducing more interactive feedback, such as
          highlighting icons or different colour text to indicate the user
          location within the site. Improving these navigation patterns would
          help accommodate different user behaviours, whether users are just
          browsing through the website or searching it with specific intent,
          this will lead to a more overall intuitive and supportive user
          experience (Torresburriel Estudio, 2024).
        </p>

        <p>
          The font sizes and contrasts are mostly sufficient for readability
          with an Arial font used for both headings and body text on the Makro
          website. This also includes a hierarchy that clearly differentiates
          between titles, subtitles and paragraph text making the websites
          information easily digestible. The icons and images usually include
          labels and context, for example for product with what it is used for.
          The weaknesses however is the site lacks visible accessibility tools
          like text resizing or screen reader optimization which limits
          inclusivity. The poor screen reader compatibility and inadequate
          keyboard navigation suggests that the needs of the users with
          disabilities were not fully integrated during the development of this
          website (Constanza-Chock, 2020). The website would also benefit from
          improving its secondary and footer navigation to include better access
          to customer service, delivery policies and frequently asked questions
          which all feel hidden in the interface.
        </p>

        <p>
          The responsiveness of the website adapts fairly well across different
          device such as a desktop, tablet and mobile device. The layout also
          adjusts to the screen size and maintains the consistent brand look.
          The mobile site can sometimes be sluggish or unresponsive when loading
          large images or promotional banners. Some interactive elements such
          the filter checkboxes or menus can be difficult to tap on smaller
          screens affecting the usability of the site on mobile devices. The
          website loading in time is exceptionally well with a loading time of
          just under 3 seconds and this is consistent even with a mobile device.
        </p>

        <p>
          Makro’s website reveals several design elements that align with the
          concept of “dark patterns,” as defined by Mathur et al. While the user
          flow is easy to navigate in terms of users being able to easily
          register, sign in and add items to their cart, the site frequently
          uses urgency cues, such as time-limited deals and stock countdown.
          This may not always reflect real-time data and while these tactics are
          common in e-commerce it can manipulate users into making a rushed
          purchasing decision based on the perceived scarcity, a dark pattern
          category identified as “urgency” (Mathur et al., 2019). The checkout
          process does include multiple delivery options like “click and
          collect” or home delivery but if an item is out of stock it sometimes
          only appears late in the purchase process. This compromises
          transparency and could lead to user frustration (Ghanchi, 2021). The
          website mostly maintains its clarity within their prices and visuals,
          but ethical issues arise when it comes to stock availability not being
          disclosed until late in the purchasing process. This process also has
          many steps which can feel long or confusing especially for a
          first-time user of the site. This also raises ethical concerns as It
          involves multiple steps that may subtly nudge users into purchasing
          marketing subscriptions without their fully confirmed consent. Ghanchi
          emphasizes that an ethical UX of a website should avoid such
          manipulations and ensure that their users are always fully aware of
          what they are opting into and purchasing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The visual design is consistent with the use of Makro’s brand colours
          which helps with the brands recognition. However there does lie a key
          issue in this visual design as the colours contrasting between the
          text and backgrounds in some promotional sections is insufficient
          making it difficult for users with visual impairments to read clearly.
          Reliance on the colour alone to display information, such as stock
          availability alerts or discount tags, fails to support users with
          colour vision deficiencies (Vaidya, 2020). The products are clear with
          images, prices and promotions are well displayed as it is the first
          thing you see on the home page. With that the homepage feels very
          content heavy with many promotions and while having promotional
          content is an expected feature of e-commerce platforms, its excessive
          presence feels like it is competing for attention. This gives the
          impression that the brands website prioritizes the sales over the user
          needs which can reduce focus and impact visual hierarchy. A design
          justice approach would prioritize co-design with actual users,
          including small business owners, rural customers, and people with
          limited digital literacy to ensure that the site meets the broader
          spectrum of user needs. The lack of these community led engagement
          contributes to the user experience being technical functional yet
          failing to empower or fully include all of its target audience. This
          outlines the importance of moving beyond usability metrics and rather
          to design processes that are inclusive and rooted in shared decision
          making (Constanza-Chock, 2020). The site relies heavily on banner ads
          and sliders which may not always be useful and can also slow down the
          experience. The use of this can clutter the interface and obstruct the
          users pathways, making it more difficult for them to focus on their
          actual goals. These design choices may be effective in driving sales,
          it also reflects a broader trend in digital commerce where user
          interfaces are shaped to benefit business outcomes at the potential
          cost of user trust and informed consent (Mathur et al., 2019).
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, in analysing the UI and UX of the Makro website through the
          lens of ethical design, accessibility, navigation structure and
          user-centred principles it becomes clear that while the site meets
          functional standards, there is definitely areas for improvement. It
          would significantly benefit the website if these ethical gaps were
          addressed to enhance navigation, responsiveness, trust within the
          user, accessibility and user prioritization. Makro’s website has a
          strong foundation and must commit to a more ethical, inclusive and
          human-centred design approach to ensure that all users, regardless of
          ability, background or intent, can navigate and interact with its
          platform easily and effectively.
